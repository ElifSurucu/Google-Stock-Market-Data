# Project Overview

This project aims to empower investors and traders by providing actionable insights derived from historical stock market data trends, specifically focusing on Google stock performance. By analyzing critical factors such as stock prices, volatility, trading volume, and market events, the project highlights opportunities for optimizing trading decisions and improving risk management strategies.

## Key Objectives:

**Identify Historical Trends**: Analyze price movements and trading volume patterns across months and years to detect seasonal trends and anomalies.

**Assess Market Volatility**: Examine periods of heightened price volatility to understand their correlation with trading volume and significant market events.

**Guide Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide systematic approaches for predicting stock performance, leveraging inferential statistics and predictive analytics.

## Key Findings:

1. **Trading Volume Trends**:

- December consistently exhibited the highest trading volumes, potentially influenced by year-end adjustments and tax-related trades.
- Major events such as 2008 (Global Financial Crisis) and 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic) saw dramatic increases in trading volume.

2. **Volatility Insights**:

- Market volatility was significantly higher during crisis periods like 2008 and 2020, underlining the need for careful risk assessment during uncertain times.
- Specific months such as March and November also demonstrated higher-than-average volatility.

3. **Price Behavior Analysis**:

- Stock prices after 2015 were significantly higher than in earlier periods, reflecting Google’s growth trajectory and increasing investor confidence.
- Price volatility correlated moderately with trading volume, suggesting that heightened activity often accompanies price swings.

### Key Benefits for Investors and Traders:
- **Optimized  Timing**: Gain insights into high-liquidity periods (e.g., December) for executing trades efficiently.
- **Risk  Mitigation**: Use volatility trends and event-based analysis to prepare for potential market fluctuations.
- **Strategic  Planning**: Leverage historical patterns to predict future behavior, aiding in buy/sell/hold decisions.

This analysis equips investors with the tools to minimize risks and maximize returns by aligning their strategies with historical market patterns and predictive analytics. Whether you are a risk-averse trader or a long-term investor, these insights provide the confidence to make data-driven decisions in a dynamic stock market environment.

## Descriptive Analysis Questions and Results:


1. What is the overall trend in Google stock closing prices over the years?

- Google stock showed an upward trend in closing prices from 2004 to 2024, with some fluctuations during financial crises like 2008 and 2020.
- Visualizations like line charts highlighted these trends and demonstrated periods of rapid growth (e.g., post-2015).
 
2 .Which months exhibit the highest trading volume?

- December consistently had the highest trading volumes, likely due to end-of-year market activities and portfolio adjustments.
- Boxplots and bar charts helped identify these monthly patterns.

3. What is the relationship between daily high and low prices?

- Daily high and low prices showed a strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.99), as expected in a consistent market.
- This finding was validated using scatterplots.

4. How does the trading volume vary over different years?

-Trading volumes were highest during market crises and tech booms, with significant spikes in 2008, 2020, and 2023.
-Year-over-year bar charts effectively communicated these patterns.

5. Are there any significant outliers in trading volume or stock prices?

- Several outliers in trading volume were observed, corresponding to major market events or earnings announcements. These were detected using boxplots.

7. What is the average daily price change across years?

- Average daily price changes were highest during volatile years like 2008 and 2020, indicating market uncertainty.
- A detailed table of yearly averages was presented for clarity.

## Inferential Analysis Questions

1. Are closing prices significantly different between two periods (e.g., before and after 2015)?

- A two-sample t-test revealed significant differences in closing prices before and after 2015 (p<0.05).

- The mean closing price post-2015 was substantially higher, reflecting Google’s growth as a major tech giant.

2. Is there a significant relationship between trading volume and price volatility?

- A Pearson correlation test indicated a moderate positive relationship (𝑟=0.35), suggesting that higher volatility often corresponds to increased trading volume.

- This insight was visualized through scatterplots and regression lines.

3. Are stock prices significantly more volatile during specific months?

- An ANOVA test showed significant differences in monthly stock price volatility (p<0.05).
- March and November had the highest volatility, while July and August were more stable. This finding can guide investors in timing their trades.

4. Does trading volume vary significantly across years or months?

- Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirmed significant differences in trading volumes across both years and months.
- December consistently showed higher trading volumes compared to other months, as depicted in heatmaps and summary tables.

5. Do stocks exhibit higher volatility after large trading volumes?

- A t-test revealed that days with higher trading volumes experienced significantly higher volatility (p<0.05).

- This finding emphasizes the importance of monitoring trading volume as an indicator of risk.

6. Is there a significant difference in trading volume between months?

- ANOVA results indicated that trading volumes vary significantly across months (p<0.05).

- Tukey HSD tests identified December as having significantly higher trading volumes compared to most other months.

7. Does the volatility in Google stock significantly differ during market crashes?

A t-test comparing crash periods (2008, 2020) with non-crash periods showed significantly higher volatility during crashes (p<0.05).

- Density plots illustrated these differences, showing increased risk during economic downturns.
